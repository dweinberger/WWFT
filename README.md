What Would Flickr Tag - pointless image tagging project while trying to learn TensorFlow.js

The idea is to train TF.js on CC-BY Flickr.com images and their tags. Then the user will input an image and the system will tell it what tags it thinks apply.

This is very much a learning project. So far, I've gotten as far as downloading images and their tags, finding the top 200 tags, filtering out iamges that don't have any of those tags, and creating a quick and dirty to confirm that I've got the right tags associated with the the right images.

Have I mentioned how embarrassing this code is? Have some decency and please don't look. Thanks.
